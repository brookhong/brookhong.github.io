================

AudioWords is a dictionary tool for you to lookup a new word and read its meanings aloud, or add it into a named collection, so that you could review it afterwards and solidify it by listening to them. AudioWords also can be used as an ePub reader, which enables you to tap on any word to retrieve its meaning.
