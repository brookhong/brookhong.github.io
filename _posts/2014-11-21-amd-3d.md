================

A problem has troubled me for a long time, before my Acer laptop broke: playing 3D movies.  
When playing 3D movies via HDMI output to a TV, the results are good.
However, on the desktop with an AMD Radeon graphics card and playing 3D movies with
HDMI output to the same TV, there is some ghosting.

I searched on the Internet for a long time before finding an answer.  But today
I did not give up and continued to search and finally solved the problem.

1. First connect the TV with HDMI, this is very important, otherwise you will not see the option you want to set.
1. Open the AMD Catalyst Control Center.
1. Go to Desktop -> Monitor -> My digital flat panel -> Scaling options (digital flat panel).
1. Drag scaling option to 0% overscan.
