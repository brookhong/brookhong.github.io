================

We usually need write a piece of snippet to test usage of some functions with some kind of script.

The common way to do:

1. create a test.php/test.py or test.js with vim.
1. launch a terminal, then run `php test.php`, `python test.py`, `node test.js`.
1. back to vim, make a change and save it, then back to terminal again, run `php test.php` etc.
1. again and again if you are not lucky enough.


## Now it comes to [k.vim](https://github.com/brookhong/k.vim)

After vim launched,

    :Ft pyt<tab>

or

    :set filetype=python

Write your code snippet, press `<leader>r` anytime to run the snippet you have input, you even need not save the snippet to a disk file.

The output of your script will be displayed in a scratch window(`:help special-buffers`), as the below line indicates:

    autocmd FileType python     nnoremap <buffer> <leader>r :call k#RunMe('python', 'botri 10', "")<CR>

Press `<space><leader>` to close the related scratch window of current buffer.

    nnoremap <silent> <space><leader> :call k#CloseConsole()<CR>

## Basic idea of k.vim

The very basic idea of the plugin is to do the following tasks without leaving vim:

* call external command
* show command output in a vim scratch window

My other two usages of the plugin:

* `<leader><leader>` to translate english word in vim with [kv](https://github.com/brookhong/kv) as you can see in the screencast above.
* convert vim into a quick launcher.

### use vim as quick launcher for some frequent commands

Create a shell script, for example, mycmds.sh, with its content as below

    curl -s https://api.github.com/gists/public
    curl -sk https://api.douban.com/v2/book/search?q=algorithm|python -mjson.tool
    ...

with each whole command in one line, whenever I need run a command, jump to the line, press `<Enter>`, the response will be displayed when it's done.

For Windows, I also have a file named cli.cmd created, all my frequent commands are in it.

### Other commands

    :Ri <command>           run vim command, read output into current buffer, for example: Ri version。
    :Rc <command>           run vim command, read output into a scratch window, for example: Rc verbose map。

    :Ri !<command>          run external command, read output into current buffer, for example: Ri !ls。
    :Rc !<command>          run external command, read output into a scratch window, for example: Rc !dir。

## Installation

    Bundle 'brookhong/k.vim'

or put k.vim under .vim/plugin.

If you need the feature to translate word in vim, you need follow below instructions to install kv.

1. get and build [kv](https://github.com/brookhong/kv), for Windows you can get pre-built binary [here](/assets/downloads/kv.zip).
1. copy kv or kv.exe to a folder in your PATH such as /usr/local/bin or C:\Windows\system32
1. build or download dictionaries you need to some folder, and tell VIM where it is

    let g:kdbDir = $HOME.'/kdb'
