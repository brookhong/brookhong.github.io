### 2014-04-28 1.0.0.1

As MAC user, I use [keycastr](https://github.com/sdeken/keycastr), an open-source keystroke visualizer to create tech demo animation.

I'm also a Windows user, I googled alternatives of keycastr for windows several times.
There are some, but none makes me happy like keycastr from MAC.

Thus one day in March of this year(2014), I finally started my own one -- KeyCastOW, the `OW` after keycast means On Windows.

For some reasons, this is not open-sourced, but it's free.

For demo, here I'm using gVim under Windows with my [vim configuration](https://github.com/brookhong/vimfiles).

My `<leader>` key in VIM is `s`, so don't be surprised when you're seeing my
actions started with `s` in normal mode.
And I do have some window operations started with `<Space>`.

Here we go.

The animations are created with [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
plus [KeyCastOW](/assets/downloads/keycastow.zip).
