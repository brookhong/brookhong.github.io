[Surfingkeys -- expand your browser with javascript and keyboard](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys)

[Demo on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crHHfd5epeg)

About two years ago, I posted a question -- [What else tools that can help one like VIM?](http://www.linkedin.com/grp/post/154653-119166234#commentID_discussion%3A119166234%3Agroup%3A154653) on linkedin.com.

My list does not change much, it still looks much like below:

* vim
* git
* chrome

But there are some changes,

* DiffMerge is not in the list anymore, as I'm getting more used to vim diff.
* chrome is still firmly in this list.

When it comes to chrome, we must talk about a particular chrome extension. I may list my favorite chrome extensions someday but there are some particulare extensions that brings the vim spirit to chrome. I used [philc/vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) for almost one year, then I switched to [1995eaton/chromium-vim](https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim) for half a year.

I'm almost happy with these two but as more and more of my daily tasks need to be done in chrome, I need a better extension.
An extension which can do what I want simply by pressing some keystrokes, that looks more like map key in vim.

vimium supports map key customization, but the target actions are limited. cVim tries to simulate vimL with a strange grammar (simulating
vimL may not even be a good idea because the [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) project is trying to deprecate vimL).
These things make it hard, for example, to map a key to a javascript function I've made.

Javascript is good enough for users to create their own mappings.  I don't need to create another lame scripting language, which is painful for both me and the users.
So I created an extension -- [Surfingkeys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys) which works like this:

```javascript
mapkey('<Ctrl-y>', 'Show me the money', function() {
    Front.showPopup('a well-known phrase uttered by characters in the 1996 film Jerry Maguire (Escape to close).');
});
```

The first parameter is the keystroke, the second is a help message that describes the action, which will also be displayed in help popover.
The third parameter is what you want the keystroke to trigger, it can be a snippet of Javascript code or a Javascript function.

Most features from vimium or cVim are implemented by adding a `mapkey` call in settings, which is totaly described in javascript. These features are:

* scroll page
* follow links
* history forward/backward
* switch/close/restore/duplicate tab
* open urls from bookmarks/history
* open search engines

Besides that, Surfingkeys provides some of my favorite features.

### Search selected with

I like this feature from when I was using Firefox. For both Firefox and Chrome, extensions are used through a context menu.
Surfingkeys does this through key mappings. By default, when you press `sg` in normal mode, it will search selected text with google, if there is none selected, it will search text from system clipboard with google. In visual mode, it will search selected text with google.

The `g` in `sg` is a search alias for google, there are some other built-in search aliases -- like `w` for bing. So press `sw` to search selected with bing. Refer to [Add search alias to omnibar](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys#add-search-alias-to-omnibar) to add your own search alias, useful for internal company search engines.

### The vim-like marks

You can create vim-like marks by pressing `m`, followed by a word character(0-9, A-Z, a-z), used as a marker. For example, if you press `ma` on this page, you'll create a mark named `a` which points to this page. Then pressing `'a` anywhere, you'll jump to this page.

Essentially, it's a faster bookmark.

### A better bookmark finder

You can find what you want by typing something, also can navigate into a bookmark folder, and search in it.

### A large cursor in visual mode

The cursor is made large for visibility, as sometimes it's not easy for human to locate a normal cursor on a web page.

## VIM editor

Thanks ACE for the vim editor, Surfingkeys integrates ACE for the vim editor. The vim editor is used:

* to edit any input on html page
* to edit URL to open in new tab
* to edit settings

### Edit any input on html page

In normal mode, press capital `I`, then use a hint letter to pick up a input box. A vim editor is opened for you to edit text. The vim editor is opened in lightly different way for `input` and `textarea`.

For `input` element, the vim editor has only one line, you use vim-bindings keys to edit your text, then press `Enter` or `:w` to write your text back to the input element.

![input_with_vim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644219/75a72b2e-61b3-11e6-8ce2-06c9cc94aeca.gif)

For `textarea` element, the vim editor is opened in bigger size, after you complete your edit, then press `Ctrl-Enter` or `:w` to write your text back to the textarea element.

![textarea_with_vim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644217/75a27e44-61b3-11e6-8f21-9cd79d3c5776.gif)

For `select` element, the vim editor is opened in bigger size, you are expected to edit the text, instead of, to search your option and jump to the line, then press `Enter` to select it. This is much handy for `select` element that has dozens of options.

![select_with_vim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644218/75a458a4-61b3-11e6-8ce7-eedcc996745c.gif)


`Esc` or `:q` to quit vim editor without writing text back.

`Tab` completion works with all words on current page, `Space` to choose a match from popup.

If you enter insert mode with `i` or mouse click, you will edit your input in normal way. You could also open vim editor at that time by pressing `Ctrl-i`.

Remember that in insert mode, press `Ctrl-i` to open vim editor.

### Edit URL to open in new tab

`su` to open vim editor to edit current URL, then `Enter` or `:w` to open the input URL, which works just like address bar with vim-binding keys.

`Tab` completion works with all URLs from bookmark/history, `Space` to choose a match from popup.

![url_with_vim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17644220/75f8eedc-61b3-11e6-9630-da2250ac5f10.gif)

### Edit settings

`se` to open settings editor, `:w` to save settings.

## Markdown preview

1. copy your markdown source into clipboard.
1. `sm` to open markdown preview, which will preview markdown from clipboard.
1. Then on the preview page, another `sm` will open vim editor to edit markdown source.
1. `:wp` to refresh preview.

![markdown](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/288207/17669897/0b6fbaf6-6342-11e6-8583-86eb8691190d.gif)

By default, Surfingkeys uses this [markdown parser](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to preview markdown, if you'd like to use [github markdown API](https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/) to parse your markdown, please add below line to your settings:

    settings.useLocalMarkdownAPI = false;

## Shortcuts reference

The default shortcuts are created per the rules:

* easy for one hand(left)
* respect famous binding from VIM
* first letter of words
